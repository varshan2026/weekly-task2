# Week 4 Task 2
Completed textbox validation system that tracks character count, prevents typing beyond 200 characters, and ensures a minimum of 80 characters for meaningful input. Error messages guide users for a seamless experience.

## How It Works  
1. As users type, the character count is updated in real-time.  
2. If input exceeds 200 characters, further typing is disabled, and an error message is shown.  
3. If input is below 80 characters, an error prompts users to write more content.
